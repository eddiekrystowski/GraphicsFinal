# GraphicsFinal

## Instructions
This project is ready to clone and run as is, except for two things:
1. The toolset used may be for Visual Studio 2019 (v142), so make sure to adjust the toolset to whatever you are using in the solution properties.
2. Run `Local Windows Debugger` build task (it will fail). Go to the `lib` folder, and copy `assimp-vc143-mtd.dll` (or `assimp-vc143-mtd.dll` if you are using Visual Studio 2019) to the newly created`x64/Debug`, this is the directory where the executable will be built.
